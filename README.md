What is Next?
So far the mechanism of graph signal processing is mostly figured out. That is the logic behind the Spectral Graph Neural Network which is one of the graph CNN methods. This method basically applies the filters on frequency domain instead of classical CNN usage as a spatial domain filter. The next step must be figuring out spatial filtering on graph signals.
